    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Changes I Made:\n",
    "1. **API Migration**: Replaced OpenAI client with Mistral AI using `ChatMistralAI` from langchain-mistralai\n",
    "2. **Environment Variables**: Changed from `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `MISTRAL_API_KEY`\n",
    "3. **Message Format**: Updated to use LangChain message objects (SystemMessage, HumanMessage) instead of OpenAI's format\n",
    "4. **Response Parsing**: Implemented JSON parsing for Mistral AI responses instead of OpenAI's structured output format\n",
    "5. **Custom Examples**: Created new evaluation examples focused on Mistral AI performance and capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### Custom Tweakings:\n",
    "1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added JSON parsing with fallback mechanism for robust evaluation\n",
    "2. **Reasoning Addition**: Extended evaluator to include reasoning explanations along with scores\n",
    "3. **Custom Questions**: Created Mistral AI-specific evaluation scenarios instead of generic LangSmith questions\n",
    "4. **Metadata Updates**: Updated sample metadata to reflect Mistral AI model usage\n",
    "5. **Temperature Setting**: Added temperature control (0.1) for more consistent evaluation results\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I Learned:\n",
    "1. **LLM-as-Judge Migration**: Successfully adapted evaluator functions from OpenAI to Mistral AI while maintaining evaluation quality\n",
    "2. **JSON Response Handling**: Learned to handle structured responses from Mistral AI using JSON parsing instead of Pydantic models\n",
    "3. **LangChain Integration**: Understood how to integrate Mistral AI with LangChain message formats for evaluation tasks\n",
    "4. **Error Resilience**: Implemented fallback mechanisms to ensure evaluators continue working even if response parsing fails\n",
    "5. **Custom Evaluation Design**: Created domain-specific evaluation examples that test model understanding of Mistral AI capabilities\n",
